    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A Jagannath Cultural and Educational Center primarily focuses on promoting and preserving the cultural traditions,
      religious practices, and spiritual teachings associated with Lord Jagannath, a Hindu deity particularly revered in the Odisha region of India;
      this often includes activities like teaching about the Jagannath mythology,
      organizing cultural events like the Rath Yatra festival, and providing educational programs about Odia culture and philosophy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Its objective is to promote and galvanize the community in all aspects of the culture, pass on the tradition of brotherhood,
      encourage educational, social, and cultural gatherings, improve mental health, focus, promote yoga and spread awareness of spiritual
      well-being among the current and future generations
