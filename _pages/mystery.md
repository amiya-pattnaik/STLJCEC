## History of the Legendary Lord Shri Jagannath


#### Lord Jagannath
As Jagannath he is called the Lord of the Universe, of the three worlds of the heavens, earth and the netherworld. He is also one of the forms of Lord Krishna, the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu.

Lord Jagannath is also popularly known as Mahaprabhu. The word Jagannath is derived from confluence of two Sanskrit words, Jagat meaning “universe” and nātha meaning “Master” or “Lord”. Thus, Jagannath means “lord of the universe”. The trio of deities consisting of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra are worshipped at the temple.

Lord Jagannath, Lord Baladev and Maa Subhadra are worshipped on the Ratnavedi along with Sudarshan chakra. The four deities are carved out of dark coloured Neem wood, which is considered auspicious for all castes. This also signifies that Jagannath is beyond space and time and , symbol of universal love and brotherhood. This depicts the uniqueness of Shri Jagannath deity unlike other deities in Hindu temples, which are carved out of stone and precious metals. The deities are adorned  with different clothing and jewels according to the season.

So to his devotees Jagannath is kind and compassionate, patiently listening to their prayers and then offering them the joy of many colourful festivals and the most delectable offering of food. Jagannath is a protective and generous god and that is why he is so beloved of his devotees.

The well-known  descriptions , as found in the Skanda-Purana, Brahma Purana and other Puranas and later Odia Puranas  state that Lord Jagannath was formerly worshipped as Shri  Neela Madhaba by a Savar king , the tribal chief , named Viswavasu.



King Indradyumma was ruling over the Malava Country in Satya Yuga , the age of Truth. He was a great devotee of Lord Vishnu. After knowing about the Lord, King Indradyumna directed a Brahmin priest, Vidyapati to discover the deity, who was worshipped secretly in a dense forest by Viswavasu. Vidyapati tried his paramount resources to locate the place, but he failed in the beginning . However, at the end, he managed to convince Viswavasu’s daughter Lalita to marry him. Following the marriage , due to  repetitive requests of Vidyapti, Viswavasu took his son-in-law blind folded to a cave where Lord Neela Madhaba was worshipped. Vidyapati was intelligent , in order to identify the path, he dropped mustard seeds on the ground , while he was travelling along Vidyapti . The  mustard seeds sprouted into plants in a few days, which identified the way to the cave later on. On hearing the good news from him, King Indradyumna proceeded instantly to Odra desha , now known as Odisha , on a pilgrimage to visit the Lord. But on arrival  he found the deity was missing. The king felt dejected  but was adamant not to return without having a darshan of the Lord . He decided to perform fast unto death at Mount Neela, then a celestial voice cried ‘Thou shalt see him.’



Subsequently, the king performed one thousand Ashwamedha Yajna (sacrifice) and built a magnificent temple for Vishnu. The first Murti of Lord Narasimha was brought by Narada which got installed in the temple. Subsequently, during sleep, the king got an image in his dream of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra and Chakra Sudarshan. A cosmological voice also directed him to bring the massive dark coloured, Divine Log of wood floating in the seashore and make idols out of it.

Sage Narada advised to bring the Divine Log of wood to a high altar, presently identified as the Mahavedi. Then Shri Visvakarma, the divine architect emerged in the guise of a wrinkly oldie carpenter and requested the king for giving him an opportunity to carve the wooden idols which were to become deities. The carpenter had made one condition with the king and queen, stating not to open the door of the till 21 days. However, just after two weeks, one fine day, the Queen became very anxious as she couldn’t hear any noise from inside. She assumed the carpenter to be dead and requested the king to open the door. On the  17th day , the king opened the door, but to their surprise , they found the three idols unfinished with incomplete  hands , and carpenter being disappeared . But a divine voice told King Indradyumana to install these deities  in the temple. The king Indradyumna then requested Shri Visvakarma to build a magnificent temple to house the deities, near the Kalpabata. Finally, the deities were installed in the temple by Brahma with divine rituals.



Lord Jagannath is known as “Darubrahma“. In the 28th Chapter of Skanda-Purana Purushottama-kshetra Mahatmya, Lord Brahma Himself reveals the true identity of Lord Shri Jagannath when He instructs King Indradyumna with these words: “Thinking it is a wooden image, O pre-eminent King, let there not be the idea in you that this is a mere image; this is verily the form of Supreme Brahman (Supreme Omnipresent God). As Param-Brahman takes away all sorrows and confers eternal bliss, He is known as Daru. According to the four Vedas therefore, the Lord is manifest in the form of Daru (sacred wood). He is the Creator of the entire Universe. He has also created Himself.” (Chapter 28, verses 39-41).  


King Indradyumna then introduced the daily and special festive rituals of the Lord, as per scriptures, which continues till date. The temple of Lord Jaganath constructed by King Indradyumna is considered to be the tallest monument of the world with 1,000 cubits high and also the most beautiful Temple for Lord Vishnu.

#### Art & Culture
As with all the great temples of India, the Jagannath shrine is also a patron of arts and crafts. The Jagannath Temple has been the centre of not just religion but also of culture. In ancient times the temple had temple dancers called maharis who performed before the deities during the pujas. These dancers created one of the most beautiful of classical dance forms that we today call Odissi. For example the square chauka posture of the Odissi dancer symbolises Jagannath who is always worshipped before every performance.

Many of the Odissi dance performances are based on the songs composed in Sanskrit by the Bengali poet Jayadev. His collection of poems written in praise of Lord Krishna called Gita Govinda is one of the classics of Indian literature and the hymns are sung everyday at the Jagannath Temple. For Oriyas Jagannath is their most sacred and dearest god and he has inspired not just literature but also paintings, sculpture and a rich tradition of crafts like woven handlooms and carvings.

The broad avenue that runs before the temple called Bada Danda is lined with shops exhibiting Puris rich traditions of art and crafts. There are the delicately painted patachitras on mythological themes; wooden replicas of the trinity of Jagannath and his siblings; the exquisite woven tie and dye Ikat handlooms and saris and silver and conch shell jewellery.
